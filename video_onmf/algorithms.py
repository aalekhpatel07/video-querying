    """Compute the Orthogonal Non-negative Matrix Factorization.

    Notes:
        This algorithm is called "Projected
        Proximal-point Alternating Least Squares"
        and is introduced in "Video Querying Via
        Compact Descriptors Of Visually Salient
        Objects".

        Given a matrix M of dimensions (m, N),
        factor it into two matrices L, and R, such that:

        - M â‰ˆ L @ R,
        - The columns of L are unit vectors,
        - Every column of R has exactly one 1, and the rest 0,
        - The (Euclidean) distance between M and L @ R is minimized amongst
            all possible L, and R with non-negative entries.


    Args:
        matrix: A numpy array of shape (m, N).
        rank: The desired number of columns in L.
        rho: Some hyper-parameter that I don't understand yet.
        maxiter: The maximum number of iterations of improvement.

    Returns:
        Matrices L, and R that satisfy the conditions given above.
